"Description": "(Sharecast News) - London stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors digested eurozone inflation data and a modest increase in US job openings.The FTSE 100 index dropped 0.56% to finish at 8,121.20 points, while the FTSE 250 declined 0.14%, closing at 20,194.47 points.In currency markets, sterling was last up 0.21% on the dollar, trading at $1.2676, while it climbed 0.24% against the euro to change hands at €1.1806.Despite the euro area inflation rate slowing to 2.5% year-on-year and the eurozone jobless rate holding steady at a record low of 6.4%, European stock indices continue to fall, said IG senior market analyst Axel Rudolph.A slightly higher-than-expected year-on-year core inflation reading of 2.9% and concerns regarding the second round of the French legislative elections on Sunday might be to blame.US indices regained earlier losses as job openings topped expectations and US Treasury yields slid on Fed chair Jerome Powell comments which reinforced bets of 2024 rate cuts.Rudolph added that ongoing carry trades amid large interest rate differentials pushed the yen to fresh 38-year lows versus the dollar, as some traders expected the Bank of Japan not to intervene before USD-JPY reached the JPY 165 November 1986 high.EUR-JPY and GBP-JPY also continue to appreciate.The oil price cautiously adds to recent gains while gold and silver prices are mixed.European inflation slows marginally, US job openings riseIn economic news, inflation in the eurozone slowed marginally in June, according to preliminary estimates from Eurostat.The harmonised index of consumer prices rose by 2.5% year-on-year, down from 2.6% in May, aligning with market expectations.Core inflation, which excludes food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco, remained unchanged at 2.9%, contrary to forecasts predicting a slight drop to 2.8%.Service sector inflation held steady at 4.1%, while non-energy industrial goods inflation was unchanged at 0.7%.Energy prices grew by 0.2%, a slight decrease from 0.3% in May, and inflation for food, alcohol, and tobacco dipped to 2.5% from 2.6%.Among eurozone countries, Belgium experienced the highest inflation rate at 5.5%, up from 4.9% in May.Spain's inflation rate decreased to 3.5% from 3.8%, while Croatia and the Netherlands both recorded a rate of 3.4%, with Croatia's inflation falling from 4.3% and the Netherlands' rising from 2.7%.Eurostat also reported that the eurozone's unemployment rate remained steady at 6.4% in May, consistent with economists' predictions and maintaining the region's record low.Across the Atlantic, job openings rose modestly in the US in May, with more Americans feeling confident enough to leave their jobs in search of new opportunities.According to the Department of Labor, job postings increased by 2.8% month-on-month to 8.14 million, surpassing expectations of a decline to 7.91 million from the revised April figure of 7.919 million.Hiring rose by 2.5% to 5.77 million, while the number of separations, including voluntary quits, increased by 1.6% to 5.422 million.The quits rate remained steady at 2.2% for the seventh consecutive month, slightly below the 2019 average.That rate is a touch below pre-pandemic levels and is consistent with ongoing moderation in wage growth but isn't sending any signals about significant weakness in the labour market, said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics.Sainsbury's in the red, REITs in focusOn London's equity markets, J Sainsbury dropped 2.87% after reporting a slowdown in first-quarter like-for-like sales growth.The supermarket giant cited declines in general merchandise and its Argos division as contributing factors.Total retail sales, excluding fuel, increased by 2.6% year-on-year in the 16 weeks to 22 June, with like-for-like sales rising by 2.7%, a sharp decline from the previous quarters' growth rates.GSK fell 1.67% following a Delaware judge's decision to allow over 70,000 lawsuits related to the heartburn drug Zantac to proceed, rejecting GSK's appeal to dismiss the cases.Beazley was down 5.24%, along with Hiscox, down 2.29%, and Lancashire Holdings, which lost 3.83%, amid concerns over the potential impact of Hurricane Beryl on insurers.United Utilities declined 2.04% after losing a Supreme Court appeal, allowing Manchester Ship Canal to sue over untreated sewage discharges.Sector peers Severn Trent and Pennon Group also saw declines of 1.8% and 2.84%, respectively.On the upside, National Grid gained 0.86% after JPMorgan Cazenove added the stock to its 'analyst focus list', citing the company's strong position for growth and a resolved balance sheet.3i Group rose 2.28% following a price target increase by Citi to 3,800p, implying a 25% upside.Citi highlighted the value of 3i Group's stake in Action, a pan-European discount retailer, and projected significant sales growth and dividend returns from Action.Tritax EuroBox jumped 3.44% after extending a deadline for a takeover offer from Brookfield Asset Management and receiving interest from other parties.Other REITs also saw gains, including Tritax Big Box REIT, up 0.64%; Renewables Infrastructure Group, ahead 0.11%; and 3i Infrastructure, which was 0.93% firmer.Outside the FTSE 350, Shoe Zone plummeted 11.54% after issuing a profit warning due to rising shipping costs and adverse weather conditions.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com.Market MoversFTSE 100 (UKX) 8,121.20 -0.56% FTSE 250 (MCX) 20,194.47 -0.14% techMARK (TASX) 4,681.57 -0.39%FTSE 100 - RisersFlutter

Investors in the region weighed South Korea's inflation data, which revealed a June rate of 2.4%, falling short of the 2.7% forecasted by economists polled by Reuters.Japanese equities in Asia surged, particularly in the banking sector, as lending rates are expected to rise, bringing the Japan equity benchmark closer to a record high, said TickMill market analyst Patrick Munnelly.Bank and insurance companies in Japan contributed significantly to the advance, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose to its highest level since late May.Munnelly noted that Hong Kong-listed property and electric car maker companies also saw a surge.Traders are considering the likelihood of another Donald Trump administration following his debate with Joe Biden last week.US stock futures dipped during Asian hours, despite Wall Street pushing higher on Monday due to a surge in tech megacaps.Markets mixed after strong session for tech on Wall StreetIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 surged past the 40,000 mark for the first time in three months, closing at 40,074.69, a 1.12% increase.The broader Topix also saw a 1.15% rise, ending at 2,856.62, just below its all-time high.Contributing to the gains on the benchmark index were companies like Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, which soared 8.56%, Minebea Mitsumi, up 7.18%, and Mercari, which gained 5.94%.Chinese markets presented a mixed picture, as the Shanghai Composite edged up by 0.08% to 2,997.01, while the Shenzhen Component fell by 0.97% to 8,812.67.Leading the gains in China were China Grand Automotive Services, Grace Fabric Technology, and Cashway Technology, each advancing over 10%.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index recorded a modest increase of 0.29%, closing at 17,769.14.Li Auto, CNOOC, and Orient Overseas International were among the top performers, rising by 4.98%, 4.91%, and 4.81% respectively.South Korea's Kospi index dropped by 0.84% to 2,780.86, influenced by the lower-than-expected inflation rate.Major decliners included Kogas, down 11.9%, Solus Advanced Materials, which fell 11.5%, and LIG Nex1, dropping 11.45%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined by 0.42%, ending the day at 7,718.20.Igo, Lovisa Holdings, and Nine Entertainment Co led the losses, falling by 3.76%, 3.67%, and 3.65% respectively.In New Zealand, the S&P/NZX 50 slightly decreased by 0.11%, closing at 11,776.73.Synlait Milk, Oceania Healthcare, and Scales Corporation were the biggest losers, dropping by 4.35%, 3.7%, and 3.14% respectively.In currency markets, the dollar was last 0.12% stronger on the yen to trade at JPY 161.66, while it increased 0.15% against the Aussie to AUD 1.5037, and climbed 0.36% on the Kiwi to change hands at NZD 1.6517.Oil prices saw an uptick, with Brent crude futures last up 0.81% on ICE at $87.30 per barrel, and the NYMEX quote for West Texas Intermediate ahead 0.84% at $84.08.Korean inflation drops to 11-month lowIn economic news, South Korea's consumer inflation dropped to an 11-month low in June as supply-side pressures eased, according to official data.The consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.4% year-on-year in June, down from a 2.7% increase in May, marking the weakest rise since July 2023.It fell short of the 2.7% median forecast in a Reuters survey of economists, providing some relief for policymakers.Statistics Korea reported a 0.2% monthly decline in the CPI, the first such drop in seven months, following a 0.1% rise in the previous month.South Korea's vice finance minister expressed optimism, anticipating consumer inflation to stabilise in the lower-to-mid 2% range in the latter half of the year.The Bank of Korea (BOK) echoed the positive sentiment, viewing the decline to mid-2% inflation as beneficial and saying it would monitor inflation's alignment with its 2% target.In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) released the minutes from its June monetary policy meeting, when it decided to hold interest rates steady.The board cited a stronger case for maintaining the current rates rather than hiking them.However, the RBA acknowledged the need to remain vigilant against upside risks to inflation, despite current data suggesting potential inflationary pressures.The minutes highlighted economic uncertainty, making future policy changes difficult to predict.While recent data did not alter the inflation outlook for reaching target levels by 2026, the RBA recognized the possibility of achieving this goal without sacrificing employment gains.Nonetheless, the board noted potential downside risks to the labour market, with vacancy rates indicating weakness and the rapid rise in business insolvencies posing a threat to jobs.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com."},

The Stoxx 600 index finished down 0.4% at 510.91, bouncing off an earlier low of 508.08 (-1.0%). The DAX in Frankfurt, the FTSE MIB in Milan and the CAC in Paris, having all dropped more than 1.1% in morning trade, finished the session down 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.3% respectively.Political uncertainty continues to dominant market sentiment this week in France as investors assess the economic outlook following the weekend's first round of legislative elections, which showed the far-right anti-immigrant National Rally (RN) party in front.Eyes now turn to this coming Sunday's second-round vote, with other parties having only until Tuesday evening to withdraw names from the election to leave those with the best chance of winning. According to the latest AFP tally, at least 200 candidates - most of whom are left-wing or centrist - have pulled out of the running in an attempt to block RN winning an absolute majority in the National Assembly..Political jitters continu[ed] to keep mainland markets under pressure, said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets. Initial gains seen in the immediate aftermath of Sunday's vote saw a short-term rebound for the CAC, but we are once again seeing those concerns resurface as we move steadily towards this weekend's final rundown in France.In other news, headline inflation across the eurozone slowed in line with expectations in June, according to preliminary estimates published by Eurostat. The harmonised index of consumer prices was 2.5% higher than last year, with annual inflation easing from the 2.6% rate seen in May. However, the annual rate of core inflation - which excludes volatile items such as food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco - held steady at 2.9%, despite expectations for a drop to 2.8%.June's small decline in eurozone inflation was not very encouraging, with the core component stuck above target reminding us that the disinflationary process will be gradual. Although disinflation will continue, stubbornly high services inflation rules out a July rate cut, said Riccardo Marcelli Fabiani, senior economist at Capital Economics.Market movers Insurance companies were largely out of favour, including Munich Re, Swiss Re, Beazley, Hiscox and Lancashire, on the back of concerns about Hurricane Beryl, a category-five storm which is tearing through the Caribbean.Fresh catering group Sodexo was a heavy faller, dropping 4% after missing sales forecasts in the third quarter. Organic sales grew 6.8% to €6.07bn, coming up short of the €6.11bn estimate.Sainsbury's fell 3% in London despite boasting a market-beating grocery performance in its first quarter, as like-for-like sales growth slowed from 4.8% in the fourth quarter to just 2.7% on the back of declines in general merchandise sales and at its Argos division.The oil and gas sector was mostly higher, tracking crude prices, though Brent had come off its daily highs by the close. Brent crude rose 0.3% to $86.86 a barrel, having touched an earlier high of $87.46 - its highest since April. BP, Shell and Repsol were notable risers.FTSE 250-listed Tritax Eurobox rallied 4% extending the deadline for Brookfield Asset Management to make an offer for the company, and revealing that it had received other expressions of interest from a number of parties."},

RBC updated its estimates on Bunzl to reflect recently completed M&A activity and the latest guidance from the company, with earnings per share estimates rising by 6-7% over the next couple of years, driving a roughly 4% uplift to the target price.The Canadian bank stated that despite Bunzl's long track record of M&A-driven EPS growth, it believes limited underlying organic growth constraints the valuation and it sees the firm's heavy B2B2C exposure as relatively unattractive versus wider business services peers under current macro conditions.Bunzl's very high conversion ratio (EBITA/gross profit) and return on average operating capital at 30% and >45% respectively in FY23 are impressive on the one hand but, on the other hand, when considered in the context of BNZL's longer-term history of organic EBITA margin contraction and thus essentially zero real organic EBITA growth, suggest a business that is structurally over-earning, said RBC Capital.We think this constrains the terminal multiple investors should be willing to pay for the business, as Porter's Five Forces inevitably assert themselves. In the meantime, the business remains dependent on recycling earnings into M&A to drive earnings growth. We currently prefer stocks at similar valuations with stronger long-term organic growth dynamics.JPMorgan Cazenove added National Grid to its 'analyst focus list' on Tuesday, noting that the company was well positioned to benefit from value-accretive networks growth at an attractive valuation, and with questions around the balance sheet answered after a £7bn equity raise.JPM noted that National Grid now expects to deliver 10% asset growth to 2029, with a rebased dividend growing in line with CPIH.We see the valuation as attractive with 35% potential upside to our sum-of-the-parts based March 2026 price target of 1,200p, the bank said.JPM, which rates the stock at 'overweight', said its bull case scenario implies 70% upside, with the stock currently trading around its bear case scenario.We believe that the shares are trading below fair value because of election uncertainty, and because of regulatory uncertainty in UK Electricity Transmission - we should begin to see clarity from the regulator's methodology decision due next week, it said.Jefferies has reiterated a 'buy' rating on Sainsbury after the supermarket chain's trading update on Tuesday, predicting a recovery in top-line performance after a first-quarter sales slowdown disappointed the market.Total retail sales excluding fuel increased by 2.6% year-on-year in the 16 weeks to 22 June, with like-for-like sales rising by 2.7%. However, this was down from the 4.8% LFL growth seen in the fourth quarter of the previous financial year and 7.4% growth in the third.Grocery sales increased by a market-beating 4.8% during the quarter, but general merchandise and clothing sales dropped by 4.3% on last year, while sales at Argos fell 6.2%.An exceptionally strong grocery performance at SBRY in Q1 was diluted by a more downbeat delivery in the general merchandise businesses, particularly Argos. This should represent the trough, which feels well understood by the market given the shares' recent underperformance, Jefferies said.Sunnier weather in recent weeks should underpin sequential acceleration, with the chief drivers through the rest of the year an improving consumer environment and an easing comp."},

The FTSE 100 was down 0.3% at 8,145.47.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: Investors are eagerly awaiting new US jobs data and a speech from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, two events which could provide the all-important clues on how the central bank might act with monetary policy.Markets' current thinking is that any sign of weakness in the American jobs market could encourage the Fed to make the long-awaited first cut in US interest rates from the 5.5% mark reached last summer. That would be seen as a move to boost US growth, by making credit cheaper and easing the pressure on US government finances in the process, to the benefit of company earnings, thanks to higher demand and lower interest bills.The theory is that lower returns on cash and lower bond yields will persuade investors to see a higher return in different, albeit riskier, asset classes, including equities.On the macro front, preliminary data from Eurostat showed that inflation across the eurozone slowed slightly in June, while the region's unemployment rate held steady.The harmonised index of consumer prices was 2.5% higher than last year, with annual inflation easing from the 2.6% rate seen in May. This was in line with the consensus forecast.However, the annual rate of core inflation - which excludes volatile items such as food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco - held steady at 2.9%, despite expectations for a drop to 2.8%.Services inflation stayed elevated at 4.1% in June, while non-energy industrial goods also remained steady at 0.7%, while energy price growth eased to 0.2% from 0.3% and food, alcohol and tobacco inflation slowed to 2.5% from 2.6%.Separate figures from Eurostat also showed the unemployment rate for the eurozone remained at 6.4% in May, matching economists' predictions and remaining at an all-time low for the region.On home shores, the latest shop price index from the British Retail Consortium and NielsenIQ showed that annual growth in prices at tills slowed significantly in June.Shop price inflation eased to a year-on-year rate of just 0.2% last month, down from 0.6% in May and the lowest rate of price growth since October 2021.Non-food prices were down 1% on last year, with deflation accelerating from the -0.8% level reported in May, while food inflation slowed to 2.5% from 3.2% a month earlier.Slowdowns were reported in both fresh food (1.5%, down from 2.0%) and ambient food (3.9%, down from 4.8%).The BRC said the deceleration in price growth was a result of heavy investments by retailers to improve operations and supply chains during the height of the cost-of-living crisis, to mitigate the impact of input cost pressures.This is clearly paying off, with shop prices having risen just 0.2% over the past 12 months, said the BRC's chief executive Helen Dickinson.Whoever wins Thursday's election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households.The last few years should serve as a warning that where business costs rise significantly, consumer prices are forced up too. The next government must address some of the major cost burdens weighing down the retail industry, including the broken business rates system, and inflexible apprenticeship levy.In equity markets, Sainsbury's was under the cosh as it reported a slowdown in first-quarter like-for-like sales growth on the back of declines in general merchandise sales and at its Argos division.Total retail sales excluding fuel increased by 2.6% year-on-year in the 16 weeks to 22 June, with like-for-like sales rising by 2.7%.

The Stoxx 600 index was down 0.8% by lunchtime in Frankfurt, with losses of 1% or more registered on the Cac 40, Dax, FTSE MIB and Ibex 35 - with the latter sinking 1.9% on the back of falls in the banking sector. London's FTSE 100 was outperforming, falling by just 0.4% due to strong gains from oil majors as Brent prices headed higher.Meanwhile, after rising strongly the previous session, stocks in France were retreating amid the prospect of a hung parliament following the weekend's snap election which showed the far-right anti-immigrant National Rally (RN) party in front.Eyes not turn to Sunday's second-round vote, with other parties having only until Tuesday night to withdraw from the election to leave those with the best chance of winning.The 'relief rally' for the euro and French stocks we described yesterday didn't last long, said chief market analyst Neil Wilson from Finalto. I think the market is under-pricing the risk re France. It's not that there will be a euro crisis on Monday morning, or a RN government would crash French bonds with a massive spending splurge, but there is undoubtedly a higher degree of economic and political uncertainty.Inflation across the eurozone slowed slightly in June, according to preliminary estimates published on Tuesday by Eurostat. The harmonised index of consumer prices was 2.5% higher than last year, with annual inflation easing from the 2.6% rate seen in May. This was in line with the consensus forecast.However, the annual rate of core inflation - which excludes volatile items such as food, energy, alcohol, and tobacco - held steady at 2.9%, despite expectations for a drop to 2.8%.June's small decline in eurozone inflation was not very encouraging, with the core component stuck above target reminding us that the disinflationary process will be gradual. Although disinflation will continue, stubbornly high services inflation rules out a July rate cut, said Riccardo Marcelli Fabiani, senior economist at Capital Economics.Market moversBanking stocks in Madrid were weighing heavily on the Ibex 35, with just three stocks on Madrid's benchmark index in positive territory. Among the worst performers was Banco Santander, Unicaja Banco, Banco de Sabadell and BBVA.Outside of Spain, banks were also in red, including HSBC, Lloyds, Deutsche Bank and UBS.Insurance companies were also out of favour, including Munich Re, Swiss Re, Beazley, Hiscox and Lancashire on the back of concerns about Hurricane Beryl, a category-five storm which is tearing through the Caribbean.Fresh catering group Sodexo was a heavy faller after missing sales forecasts in the third quarter. Organic sales grew 6.8% to €6.07bn, coming up short of the €6.11bn estimate.Sainsbury's fell in London despite boasting a market-beating grocery performance in its first quarter, as like-for-like sales growth slowed from 4.8% in the fourth quarter to just 2.7% on the back of declines in general merchandise sales and at its Argos division.A rare bright spark across the continent was the oil and gas sector, with Brent crude rising 0.8% to $87.29 a barrel - its highest since April.

On the macro front, May;s JOLTS job openings figures will be published at 1500 BST, with economists expecting to see job openings drop from 8.1m to 7.9m.Zaye Capital's Naeem Aslam said: Over in the US, there are two important things to watch out for: Firstly, we have the Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, along with the president of the ECB, as previously mentioned. Second, there is the JOLTS data. The expectations for the JOLTS job opening number are 7.96m, while the previous number came in at 8.06m. Therefore, if the actual number aligns with the forecast, the Fed will face less pressure to rationalise the ongoing job market weakness. However, if the number falls far away from expectations, then we could actually be looking at a situation where bad news may become good news as market players will continue to think that it is the Fed's hawkish monetary policy that is responsible for the slowdown in the job market, and they need to get their act together in order to stop further weakness in the market. Markets will shut early on Wednesday and will remain closed on Thursday for the 4th of July holiday. Reporting by Iain Gilbert at Sharecast.com"},

The FTSE 100 was called to open around 32 points lower.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: Cable remains under pressure ahead of Thursday's general election while the FTSE 100 couldn't really benefit from a softer sterling and a rapid rise in oil prices yesterday and closed the session near flat. The election uncertainty seemingly keeps the bulls on the sidelines even though a Labour win is seen as a net positive for the British stocks.The price pullbacks in the FTSE 100 are likely interesting opportunities to strengthen long positions in energy-heavy British stocks that should fully benefit from reflation trades once the election is behind.Zooming out, the FTSE 100 didn't do bad at all over the past few quarters. The index posted a fourth quarter gain in the Q2, has hit a record high in May and remains upbeat as we enter the second half on expectation of more political stability, an upcoming Bank of England (BoE) rate cut and improved reflation flows.According to the latest shop price index from the British Retail Consortium and NielsenIQ, the annual growth in prices at UK tills slowed significantly in June.Shop price inflation eased to a year-on-year rate of just 0.2% last month, down from 0.6% in May and the lowest rate of price growth since October 2021.Non-food prices were down 1% on last year, with deflation accelerating from the -0.8% level reported in May, while food inflation slowed to 2.5% from 3.2% a month earlier.Slowdowns were reported in both fresh food (1.5%, down from 2.0%) and ambient food (3.9%, down from 4.8%).The BRC said the deceleration in price growth was a result of heavy investments by retailers to improve operations and supply chains during the height of the cost-of-living crisis, to mitigate the impact of input cost pressures.This is clearly paying off, with shop prices having risen just 0.2% over the past 12 months, said the BRC's chief executive Helen Dickinson.Whoever wins Thursday's election will benefit from the work of retailers to cut their costs and prices, easing the cost of living for millions of households, Dickinson said.The last few years should serve as a warning that where business costs rise significantly, consumer prices are forced up too. The next government must address some of the major cost burdens weighing down the retail industry, including the broken business rates system, and inflexible apprenticeship levy.In corporate news, Sainsburys backed its full-year outlook as it posted a 3% rise in first-quarter like-for-like sales.Elsewhere, Endeavour Mining announced its first gold pour at the Lafigué mine in Côte d'Ivoire, completing the project on budget and ahead of schedule 21 months after construction started.The FTSE 250 company said the mine was expected to reach commercial production and ramp up to a plant capacity of four million tonnes per annum by the third quarter, with initial production estimated between 90,000 and 110,000 ounces of gold in 2024, increasing to 200,000 ounces in 2025. It was the fifth successful project Endeavour had built in West Africa in the last decade.Capita said it has renewed its contract with the Cabinet Office to administer the Royal Mail Statutory Pension Scheme (RMSPS) for six years starting in 2026, with a potential two-year extension.The £48m deal would see Capita continue to serve over 350,000 RMSPS members while migrating services to a single platform using Microsoft Dynamics and other technologies. Capita had been administering the RMSPS since 2017, providing services such as finance, accounting, pension payroll, and data management."},

Private spending shrank 0.3%, while public spending rose 0.5%.In the corporate space, Chewy shares were down more than 6% after regulatory paperwork showed that Reddit trader 'Roaring Kitty' had snapped up 9.0m shares in the company, while Spirit Aerosystems traded higher on the back of news that aeronautical giant Boeing would buy back the fuselage maker.Markets will be closed on Thursday in observance of the Independence Day holiday.

The FTSE 100 was up 0.3% at 8,191.46.Over the weekend, Marine Le Pen's National Rally got 33% of the votes in the first round of parliamentary elections. The left wing New Popular Front alliance was second with 28% of the votes, while President Macron's centrist Together coalition got 20%.French stocks were off earlier highs but still up sharply, with the CAC 40 1.5% higher. Germany's DAX was up 0.3% and the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was ahead 0.5%.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: Elections dominate the agenda this week. Overnight results saw the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) take a significant lead in the first round of French parliamentary elections. However, the lead was somewhat lower than expected and there was something of a relief rally in the euro and French stocks.The second-round election run-offs are now anticipated to result in a hung parliament rather than an absolute majority for RN. The big risk exercising the market is higher public spending, which puts pressure on France's strained public finances.UK elections at the end of this week look set to produce a more predictable result, with the market only likely to be disturbed in the short term if polling is a long way off and Labour fail to claim a majority, given the implications this might have for further political instability and uncertainty.On home shores, data from the Bank of England showed that mortgage approvals dipped in May as higher mortgage rates continued to take their toll.Net mortgage approvals for house purchases edged down to 60,000 from 60,800 in April. Economists were expecting a figure of 59,900. Meanwhile, approvals for remortgaging came in at 29,600, down from 29,900.Figures also showed that consumer borrowing came in at £1.5bn in May, up from £800m in April.Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist, said: The strong recovery in mortgage demand seen in the early part of the year has petered out of late, in keeping with the rise in quoted mortgage rates over the past few months. Net secured lending also fell to £1.2bn from £2.2bn in April, although that was due to a significant rise in repayments. Gross lending continued to increase, reflecting the pickup in approvals at the start of the year.Swap rates have remained broadly stable over the past couple of months, and they should remain close to these levels if - as the EY ITEM Club expects - the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) begins gradually cutting interest rates from August. This, in turn, points to quoted mortgage rates remaining close to current levels, so the relative stability in mortgage demand should also continue.Separately, a survey revealed that growth in the UK manufacturing sector slowed slightly in June.The S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index nudged down to 50.9 from a 22-month high of 51.2 in May. It came in above the 50.0 mark that separates contraction from expansion but below the flash estimate of 51.4.The survey showed that optimism remained close to May's 27-month high, with 57% of firms expecting output to rise over the coming year.Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May's recent highs. The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins. In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe.Earlier, data from Nationwide showed house price growth was broadly stable in June.On the year, house prices rose 1.5% following 1.3% growth in May. On the month, meanwhile, prices were 0.2% higher in June, down from 0.4% growth a month earlier. The average price of a home stood at £266,604, versus 264,249 in May.In equity markets, British Gas owner Centrica rallied after an upgrade to 'buy' from 'hold' at Berenberg, on the expectation that the group will use £1bn of its cash to extend its share buyback programme.Land Securities and British Land were higher after HSBC upgraded the shares to 'buy' and 'hold', respectively. Assura and Primary Health Properties also gained after an upgrade to 'buy' by the same outfit.Trustpilot advanced after JPMorgan Cazenove placed the shares on 'positive catalyst watch' ahead of the first-half trading update on 11 July, saying it expects another period of adjusted EBITDA ahead of expectations.On the downside, mining giant Anglo American slumped after saying it had been forced to suspend production at its Grosvenor steelmaking coal mine in Queensland after an underground coal gas ignition incident at the weekend.No injuries were reported and all workers were evacuated safely. Grosvenor is expected to contribute 3.5m tonnes of steelmaking coal to Anglo's 15-17m total in 2024 - though the company said it will update the market with guidance once more information is available.Market MoversFTSE 100 (UKX) 8,191.46 0.33% FTSE 250 (MCX) 20,358.45 0.36% techMARK (TASX) 4,723.93 0.18%FTSE 100 - RisersSmurfit Kappa Group (CDI) (SKG) 3,624.00p 2.66% Centrica (CNA) 138.40p 2.59% Phoenix Group Holdings (PHNX) 534.00p 2.40% Land Securities Group (LAND) 634.00p 2.34% Standard Chartered (STAN) 732.40p 2.29% Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY) 55.92p 2.16% Glencore (GLEN) 460.55p 2.09% Barratt Developments (BDEV) 481.50p 1.97% Sainsbury (J) (SBRY) 259.60p 1.80% Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 144.70p 1.79%FTSE 100 - FallersAnglo American (AAL) 2,447.00p -2.20% BAE Systems (BA.) 1,292.00p -2.12% Beazley (BEZ) 694.00p -1.98% Relx plc (REL) 3,593.00p -1.26% Experian (EXPN) 3,650.00p -0.98% Admiral Group (ADM) 2,592.00p -0.88% Hikma Pharmaceuticals (HIK) 1,876.00p -0.79% Croda International (CRDA) 3,917.00p -0.79% Burberry Group (BRBY) 871.20p -0.75% Sage Group (SGE) 1,080.50p -0.73%FTSE 250 - RisersW.A.G Payment Solutions (WPS) 64.40p 5.57% Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings (AML) 150.10p 4.45% Investec (INVP) 594.50p 3.66% Trustpilot Group (TRST) 222.50p 3.49% Helios Towers (HTWS) 120.40p 3.44% XPS Pensions Group (XPS) 309.00p 3.34% Ninety One (N91) 172.40p 2.99% Trainline (TRN) 323.00p 2.74% Pets at Home Group (PETS) 303.20p 2.64% FirstGroup (FGP) 162.20p 2.46%FTSE 250 - FallersBaillie Gifford US Growth Trust (USA) 198.40p -1.78% Wizz Air Holdings (WIZZ) 2,200.00p -1.61% Pagegroup (PAGE) 418.80p -1.55% Lancashire Holdings Limited (LRE) 606.00p -1.30% Allianz Technology Trust (ATT) 391.50p -1.26% HarbourVest Global Private Equity Limited A Shs (HVPE) 2,440.00p -1.21% Auction Technology Group (ATG) 495.00p -1.20% Moonpig Group (MOON) 188.40p -1.15% Edinburgh Worldwide Inv Trust (EWI) 145.60p -1.09% Wood Group (John) (WG.) 204.00p -1.07%"},

"Description": "(Sharecast News) - London stocks ended Monday with mixed results as investors navigated a mix of UK economic data and the outcome of the French elections.Results from the first round of polling overnight indicated the far-right would likely not secure an absolute majority in the second round of voting.The FTSE 100 inched up 0.03% to close at 8,166.76 points, while the FTSE 250 dipped 0.32%, ending the day at 20,222.08.In currency markets, sterling was last up 0.05% on the dollar to trade at $1.2651, while it slipped 0.09% against the euro, changing hands at €1.1790.It's not been a roaring start to the week in London, but the gains for continental markets have spilled over, while both Land Securities and British Land have made strong gains following a broker upgrade, said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp.For now European markets are enjoying a relief rally, but with French yields still rising there is plenty of nervousness about the outlook for France and the French economy.Beauchamp added that July had been a strong month for the last decade, but the first session had not gotten off to a particularly cheery start.Early gains for the Dow were promptly walloped by a weaker ISM manufacturing figure, which was below 50 for the third month in a row.With Thursday out of the picture it looks like investors will be twiddling their thumbs for most of the week.UK manufacturing sector slows in JuneIn economic news, the UK's manufacturing sector experienced a slight slowdown in June, as revealed by the S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI).The index dipped to 50.9 from May's 22-month high of 51.2, remaining above the 50.0 threshold that indicates expansion.However, it fell short of the initial flash estimate of 51.4.Despite the slowdown, optimism persisted, with 57% of firms expecting an increase in output over the coming year, close to May's 27-month high.The UK manufacturing sector is enjoying its strongest spell of growth for over two years, with June seeing output and new order growth sustained at robust rates similar to May's recent highs, said Rob Dobson, director at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The performance of the domestic market remains a real positive, providing a ripe source of new contract wins.In contrast, the ongoing weak export performance is concerning, with manufacturers reporting difficulties in securing new business in several key markets including the US, China and mainland Europe.UK mortgage approvals meanwhile decreased in May due to higher mortgage rates, according to the Bank of England.Net mortgage approvals for house purchases fell to 60,000 from 60,800 in April, slightly above economists' expectations of 59,900.Remortgage approvals also saw a small decline, coming in at 29,600 compared to 29,900 the previous month.Consumer borrowing, however, increased significantly to Â£1.5bn in May from Â£800m in April.The strong recovery in mortgage demand seen in the early part of the year has petered out of late, in keeping with the rise in quoted mortgage rates over the past few months, noted Peter Arnold, EY UK chief economist.Net secured lending also fell to Â£1.2bn from Â£2.2bn in April, although that was due to a significant rise in repayments.Gross lending continued to increase, reflecting the pickup in approvals at the start of the year.House prices in the UK remained broadly stable in June, as per data from lender Nationwide.Annual house price growth was 1.5%, up from 1.3% in May, while monthly growth was more modest at 0.2%, down from 0.4% in May.The average home price rose to Â£266,604 from Â£264,249.Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said prices were around 3% below the all-time high recorded in the summer of 2022.Housing market activity has been broadly flat over the last year, with the total number of transactions down by around 15% compared with 2019 levels, he said.Transactions involving a mortgage are down even more (nearly 25%), reflecting the impact of higher borrowing costs.By contrast, the volume of cash transactions is actually around 5% above pre-pandemic levels.On the continent, the eurozone's manufacturing sector contraction was less severe than initially estimated in June.Revised data from S&P Global and the Hamburg Commercial Bank (HCOB) lifted the manufacturing PMI to 45.8 from an initial reading of 45.6.That marked a slight improvement, although the sector remains in contraction.Notably, manufacturing PMIs for Germany, France, and Italy were all revised higher.Across the Atlantic, the US manufacturing sector saw a further slight decline in activity last month, with the Institute for Supply Management's PMI falling to 48.5 from 48.7 in May.That was below economists' forecast of 49.1.The survey indicated reduced orders and softer demand across various subsectors, although price pressures eased.Finally on data, Chinese manufacturing activity expanded at its quickest rate in over three years, driven by production gains despite slowing demand.The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI, focusing on smaller firms, rose to 51.8 in June from 51.7 in May, surpassing expectations of 51.2.Growth was particularly strong in consumer and intermediate goods, outpacing investment goods.Centrica rises on broker upgrade, Anglo American in the redOn London's equity markets, British Gas owner Centrica increased 1.3% following an upgrade from 'hold' to 'buy' by Berenberg, driven by expectations that the company will utilise Â£1bn of its cash reserves to extend its share buyback programme.Both Land Securities and Primary Health Properties experienced gains, with shares rising by 2.07% and 1.36% respectively.The increases were prompted by HSBC upgrading both stocks to 'buy'.Trustpilot Group saw a rise of 4.19% after JPMorgan Cazenove placed the shares on 'positive catalyst watch' ahead of the first-half trading update scheduled for 11 July.JPMorgan said it expected the company to report adjusted EBITDA figures that surpass market expectations.On the downside, mining giant Anglo American faced a decline of 1.56% after announcing a suspension of production at its Grosvenor steelmaking coal mine in Queensland.The suspension followed an underground coal gas ignition incident over the weekend.While no injuries were reported and all workers were safely evacuated, the mine's closure was expected to impact its contribution to Anglo's annual steelmaking coal output, projected at 3.5 million tonnes for 2024.The company said it would provide updated guidance once more information becomes available.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com.Market MoversFTSE 100 (UKX) 8,166.76 0.03% FTSE 250 (MCX) 20,222.08 -0.32% techMARK (TASX) 4,699.99 -0.33%FTSE 100 -

The FTSE 100 was called to open around 33 points higher.Over the weekend, Marine Le Pen's National Rally got 33% of the votes in the first round of parliamentary elections. The leftwing New Popular Front alliance was second with 28% of the votes, while President Macron's centrist Together coalition got 20%.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said: The kneejerk reaction was a jump in the euro in the early week trading. The EURUSD jumped past 1.0750, the euro-pound flirted with the 0.85 level and the European futures trade in the positive as a 'buy the rumour sell the fact' reaction to the election outcome - and also on chatter that National Rally may not secure an absolute majority in the second round. But there is a non-neglectable chance for Marine Le Pen and Mr, Bardella to win the parliamentary majority next week and that risk will unlikely let the euro run too high before more clarity.Across the Channel, the week starts with increased election vibes as well, because Brits will be headed to their own general election this Thursday with little suspense on the horizon. A Labour win is seen as a net positive for financial markets, and would benefit to banks, homebuilders and groceries the most according to JP Morgan. A Labour should also benefit to the British pound in the long run on hope of improved relations with Europe post- Brexit.In the short run, however, a Labour win is broadly priced in. Therefore the return of the Bank of England (BoE) doves following the election could keep the pound's upside potential limited.Investors were also digesting the latest data from Nationwide, which showed house price growth was broadly stable in June.On the year, house prices rose 1.5% following 1.3% growth in May. On the month, meanwhile, prices were 0.2% higher in June, down from 0.4% growth a month earlier.The average price of a home stood at £266,604, versus 264,249 in May.Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said prices were around 3% below the all-time high recorded in the summer of 2022.Housing market activity has been broadly flat over the last year, with the total number of transactions down by around 15% compared with 2019 levels, he said. Transactions involving a mortgage are down even more (nearly 25%), reflecting the impact of higher borrowing costs. By contrast, the volume of cash transactions is actually around 5% above pre-pandemic levels.Gardner continued: While earnings growth has been much stronger than house price growth in recent years, this hasn't been enough to offset the impact of higher mortgage rates, which are still well above the record lows prevailing in 2021 in the wake of the pandemic. For example, the interest rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage for a borrower with a 25% deposit was 1.3% in late 2021, but in recent months this has been nearer to 4.7%.As a result, housing affordability is still stretched. Today, a borrower earning the average UK income buying a typical first-time buyer property with a 20% deposit would have a monthly mortgage payment equivalent to 37% of take-home pay - well above the long run average of 30%.In corporate news, Croda International said it had appointed Johnson Matthey chief financial officer Stephen Oxley to the same role at the chemicals company. Oxley was previously a Partner at KPMG where he spent nearly 30 years advising global companies across consumer, healthcare and industrial sectors, Croda said in a statement. He is expected to join the firm no later than April 1, 2025 following a notice period.Mining giant Anglo American said it had been forced to suspend production at its Grosvenor steelmaking coal mine in Queensland after an underground coal gas ignition incident at the weekend.No injuries were reported and all workers were evacuated safely. Grosvenor is expected to contribute 3.5m tonnes of steelmaking coal to Anglo's 15-17m total in 2024 - though the company said it will update the market with guidance once more information is available."},

Patrick Munnelly, market analyst at TickMill Group, said the coming week would be filled with significant events, including elections in the UK, important data releases such as US payrolls, and speeches by key figures like Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde.This is likely to lead to a volatile start to July, he noted.France's legislative election may cause market volatility on Monday, especially if there is a shift to the left.In Europe, key data includes final June PMIs, flash HICP, May unemployment and retail sales, German CPI, and industrial production.The UK will hold an election on Thursday, with the Labour Party expected to win according to polls.Any reaction to a Labour government was expected to be minimal, Munnelly said.Japan's second-quarter Tankan survey is the only significant release in a quiet week for data.The Reserve Bank of Australia's June meeting minutes, as well as retail sales and trade data, are also due for release.Most markets start the second half in the greenIn Japan, the Topix index reached a new 34-year high, rising by 0.52% to close at 2,824.28, while the Nikkei 225 saw a modest gain of 0.21%, finishing at 39,631.06.The surge for the benchmark index was bolstered by significant gains in retail and shipping stocks, with J.Front Retailing soaring 14.72%, Takashimaya up by 11.06%, and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha advancing 6.84%.However, Japan revised its first-quarter GDP contraction by more than one percentage point year-on-year.Chinese markets also reflected optimism despite ongoing concerns in the manufacturing sector.The Shanghai Composite rose by 0.92% to 2,994.73, and the Shenzhen Component increased by 0.57% to 8,899.17.Notable performers in Shanghai included Jilin Yatai Group, Kangxin New Materials, and China Grand Automotive Services, all of which posted gains exceeding 10%.The uptick came even as China's official manufacturing PMI remained in contraction territory for the second consecutive month, though a private survey indicated the sharpest improvement in business conditions in three years.South Korea's Kospi index climbed 0.23% to 2,804.31, supported by strong performances from Hyundai Glovis, up 9.82%, EcoPro Materials, rising 6.93%, and LG Energy Solution, which gained 6.28%.In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 fell by 0.22% to 7,750.70, weighed down by significant declines in companies like Guzman Y Gomez, which dropped 9.45%, Pro Medicus, down 5.31%, and Wisetech Global, which fell 5.18%.New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 posted a gain of 0.61%, closing at 11,789.39, driven by strong showings from Fletcher Building, Meridian Energy, and Sky Network Television, which rose 6.36%, 4.93%, and 3.83% respectively.Markets in Hong Kong were closed for the Special Administrative Region Establishment Day holiday.Currency markets showed minor movements, with the dollar last 0.06% stronger on the yen, trading at JPY 160.98, while the greenback weakened against the down under dollars, falling 0.25% on the former to AUD 1.4956, and retreating 0.18% from the latter to change hands at NZD 1.6386.Oil prices saw modest increases, with Brent crude futures last up 0.49% on ICE at $85.42 per barrel, and the NYMEX quote for West Texas Intermediate rising 0.54% to $81.98.China manufacturing data comes in mixed, Japan revises down GDP readingIn economic news, China's unofficial Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for June unexpectedly rose to 51.8, slightly up from May's 51.7 and surpassing market expectations of 51.2.The improvement in the private survey contrasted with official data released over the weekend, which indicated ongoing struggles in the manufacturing sector.According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), China's official manufacturing PMI remained at 49.5 in June, unchanged from May, marking the second consecutive month in contraction territory.The figure aligned with market forecasts and highlights persistent weaknesses across several sub-indexes, including new orders, raw material stocks, employment, and new export orders.Meanwhile, the non-manufacturing PMI, which encompasses services and construction, fell to 50.5 from 51.1 in May, reaching its lowest point since December.The services PMI dropped to a five-month low of 50.2, while the construction PMI decreased to 52.3, the weakest reading since July of the previous year.In Japan, the government revised its first-quarter GDP figures, revealing a sharper contraction than initially reported.The economy shrank at an annualised rate of 2.9% from January to March, down from the previously estimated 1.8% contraction.That unexpected revision, attributed to corrections in construction orders data, cast a shadow over Japan's fragile recovery.Revisions also affected earlier periods, with October-to-December growth adjusted to 0.1% from 0.4%, and July-to-September contraction deepened to 4.0% from 3.7%.However, there was a glimmer of positive sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers, as revealed by the Bank of Japan's latest Tankan survey.The main index for sentiment among large manufacturers rose to +13 in June, up from +11 in March and slightly above economists' expectations of +12.That improvement, driven by a weak yen boosting exporters' overseas earnings, marked the highest level of business confidence since March 2022.The index measures the percentage of companies reporting favourable business conditions against those reporting unfavourable conditions, indicating a cautiously optimistic outlook among Japan's manufacturing sector.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com."},

"https://www.fidelity.co.ukhttps://www.fidelity.co.uk/shares/stock-market-news/market-reports/london-close--stocks-fall-as-us-inflation-pressures-ease/?articleid=34395991&categoryid=0200,0201,0202,0204,0207,0208,0209,0210,0212,0214,0218,0227,0228,0229", "Description": "(Sharecast News) - London's stock markets closed lower on Friday, influenced by new economic data from the United States indicating a slowdown in consumer spending, despite a reduction in inflationary pressures.The FTSE 100 index fell by 0.19%, ending the day at 8,164.12 points, while the FTSE 250 saw a decline of 0.23% to close at 20,286.03 points.On the currency front, sterling was last down 0.01% on the dollar, trading at $1.2638, while it decreased 0.1% against the euro to change hands at €1.1796.The leading stock index in Britain started the day with gains on Friday, but has not managed to maintain the momentum and is now rotating around the flatline, said TickMill market analyst Patrick Munnelly.However, the FTSE is heading towards its fourth consecutive quarterly increase, as stronger-than-expected local economic growth figures outweighed investor concerns.Munnelly noted official data revealing that Britain's economy expanded by 0.7% in the first quarter of the year, surpassing the prior quarter's growth of 0.6%.These numbers come as the country prepares for parliamentary elections on 4 July, where polls indicate a potential leadership change with Labour Party leader Keir Starmer potentially replacing Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak.US consumer spending growth slows despite lower price pressuresIn economic news, consumer spending in the United States increased less than anticipated last month, even as inflationary pressures eased.The Department of Commerce reported that personal incomes rose by 0.5% in May, slightly above the consensus forecast of 0.4%.However, personal consumption expenditures only grew by 0.2%, falling short of the expected 0.3%.Additionally, April's consumption growth was revised down to 0.1%.The year-on-year increase in the headline PCE price deflator slowed from 2.7% in April to 2.6% in May, while the core PCE price deflator decreased from 2.8% to 2.6%.At the same time, the personal savings rate improved to 3.9% from 3.7%.There is a good chance that core PCE inflation will fall to 2.5% in June, although unfavourable base effects make a further decline in the second half of this year unlikely, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.Taken together, the return to the earlier disinflationary trend and new-found weakness in real activity, are both consistent with the Fed cutting interest rates as soon as this September.On home shores, the UK's economy performed better than initially estimated in the first quarter of the year.According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK's GDP grew by 0.7%, up from the initial estimate of 0.6%.That growth followed contractions of 0.1% and 0.3% in the third and fourth quarters of the previous year, respectively.The services sector expanded by 0.8%, revised up from 0.7%, while production growth was revised down to 0.6% from 0.8%.The construction sector saw a contraction of 0.6%.Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the upward revision to first-quarter GDP suggests whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger than our already above-consensus forecast.In the eurozone, inflation rates eased in two of its largest economies in June.Spain's annual consumer price inflation fell to 3.4% from May's 3.6%, driven by lower food and fuel prices, although it slightly exceeded analyst expectations of 3.3%.The core inflation rate remained steady at 3%, while the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) decreased to 3.5% from 3.8%.France saw its inflation rate drop to 2.1% in June from 2.3% in May, with the HICP also falling to 2.5% from 2.6%.Both declines were largely attributed to lower food and energy costs and aligned with forecasts.In contrast, Italy's consumer price index remained unchanged at 0.8%, contrary to expectations for a slight increase, and the HICP edged up to 0.9% from 0.8%.Finally on data, Germany faced a rise in unemployment beyond expectations in June.Official data indicated that the number of unemployed increased by 19,000 in seasonally adjusted terms, surpassing the forecasted rise of 15,000.Tyman rises on higher takeover offer, JD Sports slidesOn London's equity markets, Tyman's shares rose by 3.4% following Quanex Building Products' revised and final recommended cash and share offer.The new proposal included a special interim dividend of 15p per share, adding to the previous offer of 240p and 0.05715 of a new Quanex share per Tyman share.Moonpig Group saw a 4.74% increase after the online greeting card retailer reported a significant jump in annual sales and profits, boosting investor confidence.On the downside, JD Sports Fashion fell by 3.85%, impacted by Nike's significant drop on Thursday.Nike's announcement of a cut in full-year guidance and an expected 10% sales decline for the current quarter, citing weak sales in China and inconsistent consumer trends, weighed heavily on JD Sports.Auction Technology Group experienced a substantial decline of 7.72% after private equity firm TA Associates sold a 5% stake in the company through a share placement with institutional investors.WPP shares dropped 2.56% despite Citi reiterating its 'buy' rating.The advertising and media giant's rejection of a bid from KKR to take control of its corporate PR firm FGS Global contributed to the decline.Citi said the development could reveal considerable hidden value at WPP as the bid increases pressure on the company to accelerate the pathway to shareholder value including a broader review of its holdings and owned/operated assets.The bank said: Fully dismantling the holding company would not likely be plan A for the management of WPP, in our view.This said, the magnitude of the gap between public market and private valuations of the PR business, in particular, suggests there is a potentially fairly significant opportunity for WPP to create value for shareholders without significantly undercutting the longer-term prospects for growth.Outside the FTSE 350, Keywords Studios jumped 5.6% after announcing it had received an improved Â£1.96bn takeover proposal from private equity firm EQT Group.The company indicated it would be inclined to recommend the offer if it became firm, driving the stock's rise.Reporting by Josh White for

In a statement on the Atlanta Fed website, he said: Taking all the circumstances into account, I continue to believe conditions will likely call for a cut in the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of the year.However, a cut was not yet locked-in, he added.According to the Department of Commerce on Friday, in seasonally adjusted terms personal incomes rose at a month-on-month pace of 0.5% in May (consensus: 0.4%).Personal consumption expenditures on the other hand increased by just 0.2% (consensus: 0.3%) and the prior month's rise was revised down by a tenth of a percentage point to 0.1%.Core PCE prices meanwhile slowed from an annual rate of 2.8% for April to 2.6% in May.For its part, the University of Michigan said that American's inflation expectations one year ahead fell back from 3.3% to 3.0%.Nike shares were down 19% following the release of a disappointing set of quarterly results on Thursday evening, in which it slashed its sales guidance for the fiscal year ending 2025.

Cooling inflation, alongside data yesterday which showed higher recurring unemployment and a drop in manufactured capital goods add to this narrative, although GDP growth for the first quarter was revised slightly upwards. If the PCE print is hotter than expected, it will reignite concerns of inflation having reaccelerated, while also pushing out the likelihood of an imminent cut.In equity markets, Tyman gained after Quanex Building Products announced an increased and final recommended cash and share offer the company.

Anglo was cut to 'sell' from 'hold' and the price target reduced to 2,000p from 3,000p on the bank's expectation that the reality of executing the company's new plan disappoints the market.It noted that on 29 May, Anglo rejected a request for another extension of the 'put up or shut up' (PUSU) deadline following three unsuccessful bids for the company by BHP and an extension of the PUSU deadline by a week.Consequently, BHP stepped away from its bid and Anglo survives to fight another day, it said.However, Anglo now needs to execute its new strategy flawlessly, in our view, having rejected a final bid priced at 3,111p per share; the shares closed on 26 June at 2,528p, or a 19% discount to the final BHP bid price.In our view, while the BHP proposal had its structural challenges, solutions were possible, we think, and we struggle to see how Anglo's new strategy can deliver value comparable to the final BHP bid.The failure of Anglo shares to rally towards the final bid price reflects the market's concern that it will not deliver this value, we think.Berenberg also downgraded its stance on Rio Tinto, to 'hold' from 'buy' and cut the price target to 5,800p from 5,900p.The bank said its downgrade was prompted by a more cautious view on China and iron ore. It also noted that Rio's lack of action in terms of growth, while conservative, means Berenberg thinks it could have missed some good opportunities to secure attractive growth at better valuations. It said the main commodity it thinks it should have been more active on here is lithium.Aside from this, the company is steadily growing copper volumes and is progressing the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, it said.Berenberg maintained its 'hold' rating on BHP and said it thinks the company will need to increase investment in projects such as Copper South Australia and Escondida to both grow and stabilise its copper production.Analysts at Deutsche Bank stood by their 'sell' recommendation and 600.0p target price on shares of Liontrust Asset Management following the firm's final results published the day before.In their opinion, the shares were trading above what could be justified by current fundamentals.Among other things, they estimated that its assets under management were running about 2% below the level seen in March.Furthermore, Liontrust had registered about £0.8bn of net outflows thus far in the current quarter, they said.Other negatives in their opinion included a low industry growth outlook, a strategy that was not obvious and the absence of any catalyst that might return the group to net inflows, a risk to its guidance for operating margins and growing risk to its dividend in future years."},

However, the decline in the benchmark index masked a mixed performance across the continent, with indices in Paris and Milan dropped more than 1%, falling 0.5% in London but rising 0.3% in Frankfurt - with the latter helped by gains from some heavyweight blue chips.The Stoxx 600 finished at 512.72 - its lowest closing level since 17 June.In economic data, the eurozone June Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) declined slightly in June to 95.9 from 96.1 in May, missing expectations of a small rise, while employment expectations fell below their long-term average to 99.7.Rory Fennessy, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said: The June ESI corroborates the other high-frequency survey data in suggesting that the eurozone's economic recovery will be bumpy.We think GDP will rise in every quarter of 2024, but there are downside risks to growth if leading indicators fail to post a sustained recovery over the coming months.Market risk appetite was also limited ahead of a key inflation report from the US, with the personal consumption expenditures index for May due out on Friday afternoon.Should this point towards a further slowdown in price growth then the final day of June trading might go the same way as May's, which saw a strong rally.

The world's second-largest fashion retailer said net sales increased 3% in the three months to 31 May, but were set to fall by 6% in June.The new fared badly for other European retail peers, such as Zalando and Inditex, which were also out of favour.Watches of Switzerland surged 8% after holding annual guidance despite weaker profits driven by lower UK sales of luxury timepieces.Shares in biopharma giant GSK tumbled 5% after a ruling by a US health agency narrowed usage recommendations for all respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, restricting the addressable market for the company's Arexvy product.Meanwhile, BP finished higher after saying it had implemented a hiring freeze and halted new offshore wind projects, as part of a strategic shift under new chief executive officer Murray Auchincloss."},

It was a brighter picture in the US, where sales rose 6% to £692m.Following the more challenging trading conditions of full-year 2024, we are cautiously optimistic about trading in full-year 2025. The industry as a whole is being more conservative on production, which we believe is a responsible approach to the long-term stability of the luxury watch market.WoS full-year guidance forecasts revenue of between £1.67bn - £1.73bn, reflecting constant currency sales growth of 9% - 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and tax margins are expected to grow by 0.2 to 0.6 percentage points from last year.The company also expanded into the high-end jewellery market last year with the purchase of Roberto Coin in the US for $130m.Watches of Switzerland was in demand with investors after saying the UK market was starting to stabilise. The company has been through a difficult period as growth moderated and cracks appeared in the luxury goods sector despite people previously thinking wealthier individuals would be immune to the cost-of-living crisis, said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.The absence of any more bad news was good enough to prompt a reassessment of the business by the market, hence a strong share price reaction to the results.Shares in Moonpig Group sparked on Thursday, after the online greeting card retailer posted a jump in annual sales and profits.Revenues in the year to 30 April came in at £341.1m, up 6.6%, while adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 13.5% at £95.5m.Pre-tax profits were ahead nearly 33%, at £46.4m.The group attributed the growth to strong trading at its core Moonpig brand - which saw revenues rise 8.2% - an improved gross margin rate and an above-forecast performance from its recently introduced subscription service.Nickyl Raithatha, chief executive, said trading had also strengthened across peak trading periods in the second half.This has been driven by our multi-year investments in technology and innovation, which continue to foster extraordinary customer loyalty, he continued.The Moonpig Plus subscription scheme has exceeded our expectations, passing the milestone of half a million members within one year.Looking to the current year, Moonpig said trading since the start of the year had been in line with expectations.It continued: In the context of the current macroeconomic environment, we expect 2025 full year revenue growth, after adjusting for temporarily higher breakage on experience vouchers in 2024, at a mid to high single digit percentage rate, underpinned by growth in orders at the Moonpig brand.UK electricals retailer Currys said trading in the current fiscal year was in line with expectations after 2023/24 adjusted earnings rose 10% and was pinning its hopes on the increasing use of artificial intelligence in electronic goods.The company, which sells everything from laptops to fridges, on Thursday said adjusted pre-tax profit of £118m, up from the £107m reported in in 2022/23. Revenue fell 4% to £8.48bn as the cost-of-living crisis continued to weigh on discretionary spending.We're planning prudently but confidently for the year ahead, on course to grow both profits and cashflow while carefully stepping back up to more normal investment levels, said chief executive Alex Baldock.Encouraged as we are by our progress, we know we can go further. For one thing, we expect artificial intelligence-powered technology to be the most exciting new product cycle since the tablet in 2010. With our partnerships, scale and expert colleagues to demystify AI, we're best-placed to benefit.In the Nordics, consumer demand remained weak as inflation and interest rate rises impacted consumer confidence and drove a market decline of 3%. However, Currys grew market share and more than doubled profits, despite a headwind from currency translation.UK & Ireland like-for-like sales fell 2%, with market share falling as the company continued to focus on more profitable sales which helped drive the rise in earnings.The company in February this year rejected multiple approaches from the US investment group Elliott, which ultimately walked away from its final £742m offer after the Currys board said it significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects.Guy Lawson-Johns, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said consumers had struggled to justify upgrading appliances, with demand for small electrical goods particularly affected, but an increase in UK consumer confidence, driven by rising economic optimism, suggested a recovery in discretionary spending may be underway.Even a partial return to the longer-term growth trends Currys previously experienced could significantly benefit the group, he added.Importantly the Nordics have also shown some signs of life, sharing in the group's underlying profit growth. But while margins have improved, prolonged weakness in consumer demand will be on everyone's mind. A continued improvement will need to be seen to before management can say the recovery job is done.Market MoverstechMARK (TASX) 4,739.97 -0.31%FTSE 250 - RisersMoonpig Group (MOON) 186.40p 17.38% Watches of Switzerland Group (WOSG) 457.00p 14.42% Serco Group (SRP) 178.20p 3.12% Just Group (JUST) 106.60p 2.90% Kier Group (KIE) 137.00p 2.85% Trainline (TRN) 326.60p 2.64% PureTech Health (PRTC) 192.40p 2.45% Direct Line Insurance Group (DLG) 206.20p 2.38% Keller Group (KLR) 1,250.00p 2.12% Balfour Beatty (BBY) 368.80p 1.99%FTSE 250 - FallersAston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings (AML) 141.20p -6.30% Currys (CURY) 72.15p -5.13% Urban Logistics Reit (SHED) 118.00p -4.53% W.A.G Payment Solutions (WPS) 62.40p -3.11% SDCL Energy Efficiency Income Trust (SEIT) 67.10p -2.89% AO World (AO.) 111.00p -2.80% TR Property Inv Trust (TRY) 309.50p -2.67% Hochschild Mining (HOC) 170.60p -2.63% Energean (ENOG) 986.00p -2.47% Sirius Real Estate Ltd.

Investors who think that the reaction has been overdone might be tempted to go bargain-hunting at these levels.Beauchamp added that US stocks had rediscovered some of their upward momentum this afternoon, though the all-important PCE price data was now less than a day away.Should this point towards a further slowdown in price growth then the final day of June trading might go the same way as May's, which saw a strong rally.A softer PCE reading could renew hopes of a September rate cut, which have taken a knock of late.Eurozone economic sentiment unexpectedly declinesIn economic news, sentiment in the eurozone saw an unexpected decline in June, according to a survey released by the European Commission.The economic sentiment indicator (ESI) dipped by 0.2 points to 95.9 in the eurozone and 96.4 in the broader European Union, countering analyst predictions of a slight increase.Consumer confidence rose marginally by 0.3 points but remained historically low at -14.The retail sector experienced the most significant drop, falling by 1 point to 7.8, the lowest in over three years.The European Commission highlighted stable confidence in industry, construction, and among consumers, while noting declines in services and retail trade.Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, saw its ESI decrease by 0.2 points.Additionally, the eurozone employment expectations indicator dropped for the third month in a row, falling 1.6 points to 99.7, below its long-term average.Across the Atlantic, the United States saw a slight decrease in initial unemployment claims last week, although continuing claims rose more than expected, as per data from the Department of Labor.Initial jobless claims fell to 233,000 for the week ending June 21, down from 239,000 the previous week, beating the forecast of 235,000.That marked the second consecutive week of declines following a 10-month high of 243,000 in early June.However, the four-week moving average of claims increased to 236,000 from 232,750. Continuing claims for the week ending June 14 rose to 1.839 million, exceeding the revised figure of 1.821 million and the forecast of 1.820 million.In central bank action, Sweden's Riksbank announced that it would keep its key interest rate steady at 3.75%, aligning with expectations.The bank said monetary policy would be adjusted gradually, with potential rate cuts of two or three times in the latter half of the year if inflation projections remained stable.Turkey's central bank meanwhile maintained its key interest rate at 50% for the third consecutive month.The country's central bank emphasised its focus on curbing soaring inflation and reiterated its commitment to a tight monetary policy until a significant and sustained decrease in monthly inflation trends was observed.DS Smith rockets, GSK falls on US health agency rulingOn London's equity markets, DS Smith surged 13.58% following news that Brazilian pulp maker Suzano had ended talks to acquire International Paper (IP).DS Smith had agreed in April to be bought by IP for £5.8bn.According to Reuters, Suzano's deal with IP was conditional on IP abandoning its bid for DS Smith.Halma rose 1.9% after announcing the acquisition of Portuguese fire detection and alarm systems maker Global Fire Equipment (GFE) for £36m.Bunzl advanced 1.05% after upgrading its profit guidance for the year, citing improved margins and successful acquisitions as key drivers for the better-than-expected performance.Moonpig Group's shares spiked 15.24% following the online greeting card retailer's report of a significant increase in annual sales and profits, reflecting strong consumer demand and effective business strategies.Luxury watch retailer Watches of Switzerland gained 8.36% after it maintained its current-year guidance and expressed cautious optimism despite a decline in annual profits due to reduced discretionary spending.Serco shares climbed 4.15% after the company upgraded its full-year profit guidance, citing good progress in the first half of the year as a contributing factor to the improved outlook.GSK shares dropped 4.81% after a US health agency ruling restricted usage recommendations for all respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, thereby narrowing the market for GSK's Arexvy product.Currys fell 5.79% despite the electricals retailer reporting that trading in the current fiscal year was in line with expectations.The company saw a 10% rise in 2023-2024 adjusted earnings, with recovery noted in its Nordics division.Burberry shares declined 6.24% as the luxury fashion brand traded without entitlement to its latest dividend.Anglo American slipped 1.6% following a downgrade from 'hold' to 'sell' by Berenberg, affecting the mining company's stock performance.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com."},

The FTSE 100 was down 0.2% at 8,206.36.Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets, said: Today sees the US economy come into sharp focus, with the final GDP and core durable goods orders data released ahead of tomorrow's crucial core PCE inflation release. Signs of weakness in the jobs market have started to spread through alternate areas of the economy, with yesterday's new home sales figure falling to a 2024 low.While the Fed will be concerned that we are seeing tentative signs of distress across parts of the US economy, the question over at which point it influences to Fed to react remains key. With Powell noting that the FOMC will want to be confident that inflation is on a pathway back down towards 2%, the decline widely anticipated for tomorrow's core PCE price index figure could yet help bolster support for a September rate cut.In equity markets, DS Smith jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 after Brazilian pulp maker Suzano said it had ended talks to buy International Paper.

By 1009 in New York, the Dow and S&P 500 were up 0.1% while the Nasdaq rose 0.2%. Analyst James Harte of Tickmill Group said stocks were holding up surprisingly well despite the recent rise in the dollar and with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq sitting just below their record-high levels reached last week.A hawkish shift from the Fed at the June FOMC has not dented the rally and while the market has paused for now, it remains very much in a bullish phase.

Claims declined for the second week after hitting a 10-month high of 243,000 in the first week of June. However, both the four-week moving average and continuing claims data for the previous week both rose.Durable goods orders rose by just 0.1% in May following a revised 0.6% gain the previous month, though that was better than the 0.1% decline predicted by analysts.Housing data for May continues to miss expectations, with pending home sales following the trend set by housing starts, building permits and new home sales over the past week. Pending sales dropped by 2.1% over the month, easing from the 7.7% slump in April but well below the 2.5% growth expected by the market.Meanwhile, revisions to GDP growth for the first quarter meant the economy expanded at an annualised rate of 1.4%, up from the preliminary reading 1.3% but still down from 3.4% in the preceding three-month period.Market moversSecond-quarter earnings season is now well underway - though doesn't really pick up for a couple of weeks when the big banks report.Micron Technology shares were down 4.5% after the data storage group disappointed investors with its sales guidance after the bell on Wednesday.

The second-quarter earnings season has officially begun, but doesn't really ramp up for a couple of weeks when the heavyweight banking sector reports. With the second-quarter earnings season upon us, it is almost time for traders to take stock and seek clarity over whether equity market valuations are currently justified, said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets.The S&P 500 finished the session up 0.2% at 5,477.9, coming close to last week's all-time closing high of 5,487.03, while the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 17,805.16, a whisper below its peak of 17,862.23. The Dow meanwhile rose just 0.04% to 39,127.8.In economic news on Wednesday, data showed that new-home sales plunged by 11.3% in May to an annualised rate of 619,000, down from a revised 698,000 the month before. This was well below the 640,000 expected by the market and the worst level since November.The figures followed much worse-than-expected housing starts and existing home sales for May released last week. Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said that while upward revisions to prior months took mitigated the downside slightly, sales for Q2 are tracking below our estimate, increasing the odds that we will make a downward revision to our forecast for Q2 residential investment.All eyes will now turn towards inflation data later in the week, with the US core personal consumption expenditures index - the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of inflation - due out on Friday morning. The annual rate of core PCE inflation is expected to have eased to 2.6% in May from 2.8% the month before.Market moversThe biggest riser on the S&P 500 was home appliances group Whirlpool Corp which jumped 17% on the back of reports that German giant Bosch was considering a takeover big for the firm.FedEx was also standout performer, surging 15% after the logistics group beat forecasts with its fourth-quarter results on both a profit and revenue basis, while next year's guidance was more or less in line with estimates. UPS also rose in sympathy.Amazon was providing a big lift as the stock rose nearly 4% to surpass the $2trn market cap mark for the first time in its history. Others in the tech sector like Apple, Microsoft, Salesforce and Tesla were also on the rise.Please note, according to our data below, Chipotle's shares were down 98%, though it was the effect of a 50-for-1 stock split - one of the NYSE's largest in history.

It said macro improvement should result in a strong return to revenue growth, especially for digital ads & affiliate product.We expect Future to outperform peers, due to its highly cyclical Tech & Gaming portfolio (66% of audience), monetised largely via digital Ads (30% of revenue) and affiliate product (10%), it said.It also noted that importantly, the top 12 websites (around 70% of traffic) show positive momentum.Our analysis, suggests that the core online audience will continue to recover and support a continued recovery in the overall audience which will enable a return to growth in digital ad and affiliate product revenue with the macro, it said. Analysts at Berenberg kept their recommendation for Whitbread at 'buy', arguing that markets were wrong to price in a continued drop in demand.The supply/demand balance in the UK continued to be favourable and the company's Accelerating Growth Plan was capable of driving strong growth in profit before tax into the medium-term.So too, the German operations were headed towards breakeven and the Euro 2024 championships would help to raise the brand awareness of Premier Inn.The shares' valuation was also supportive.Berenberg judged the 13.9 price-to-earnings multiple that the shares were trading on to be too cheap given the quality of its outlook.The broker kept its target price at 4,000.0p."},

All eyes are now firmly on Friday's PCE data in the US, at least until Sunday's French elections.Stockmarket darling Nvidia's shares were off by 1.5%, having rallied during the previous session following a recent bout of profit-taking.Responding to the inflation concerns mentioned by Beauchamp, the US dollar spot index was up by 0.41% to 106.05 and trading around its best levels of the last six months.Gold and crude oil futures were lower alongside.

It said macro improvement should result in a strong return to revenue growth, especially for digital ads & affiliate product.We expect Future to outperform peers, due to its highly cyclical Tech & Gaming portfolio (66% of audience), monetised largely via digital Ads (30% of revenue) and affiliate product (10%), it said.It also noted that importantly, the top 12 websites (around 70% of traffic) show positive momentum.Our analysis, suggests that the core online audience will continue to recover and support a continued recovery in the overall audience which will enable a return to growth in digital ad and affiliate product revenue with the macro, it said.Jefferies also said it sees further upside from a continued mix shift towards higher yielding US direct ad sales.Future has demonstrated some traction here, with a +2pp increase in share of direct and branded content as part of Digital Ads in 1H24, it noted.Jefferies said direct ads offer a 4x higher yield versus open auction.Whilst difficult to quantify, we see room for growth and margin expansion, aided by improvements in content quality and a larger US sales force, it said. We expect the benefits of US investments to become evident as the macro inflects and the US ad market recovers.Online electricals retailer AO World posted a surge in full-year profit on Wednesday, topping its own guidance range as its plan to pivot the business to focus on profit and cash generation bore fruit.In the year to the end of March 2024, adjusted pre-tax profit jumped 186% to £34.4m even as revenue dipped 9% to £1.04bn. AO World had guided to profit coming in at the top end of a range of £28m to £33m.AO said revenue was as expected following the decisive actions taken to remove non-core channels and loss-making sales and returning to growth in Q4.The company said it had strengthened its balance sheet, with overall liquidity of £116m as at the end of March, versus £89m in 2023, and net funds of £34.4m, up from £3.6m.The retailer said that despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges, it still expects to deliver on its ambition for double-digit revenue growth in FY25 and adjusted pre-tax profit of £36m to £41m.It also reiterated its medium-term guidance of adjusted pre-tax profit margin of 5%, double digit growth and earnings per share growing faster than revenue.Founder and chief executive John Roberts said: We have made good progress on our profit performance in FY24, which is a testament to the success of our strategic pivot to focusing on profit and cash generation.We are now a much simpler, more efficient business and are performing better than ever for customers, with excellent and sustainable unit economics.Our focus now is on delivering profitable top line growth with an ambition for double digit revenue growth in FY25.During the year we passed the milestone of 500,000 Trustpilot reviews, with an increased Trust score of 4.8 out of 5. This ranks AO as the leading and most trusted UK retailer for the combination of volume and quality and is an output of the amazing service we deliver every day for customers at scale.Alliance Trust and Witan Investment Trust are to join forces, the British firms announced on Wednesday, creating a major new £5bn vehicle.The investment trusts said the merged firm, to be called Alliance Witan, would likely qualify for inclusion in the FTSE 100.In a statement, the London-listed firms said Alliance Witan would be a more liquid, high-profile and cost-efficient one stop shop investment vehicle.They continued: With net assets of around £5bn, significant economies of scale, eligibility for FTSE 100 inclusion, powerful and well-established brand recognition on both sides and proven marketing expertise...Alliance Witan will aim to be the UK's leading global equity investment proposition.Under the terms of the deal, Witan's assets will roll into Alliance in exchange for the issue of new Alliance Witan shares to Witan shareholders.Alliance Trust's manager, Willis Towers Watson, will have overall responsibility for managing the combined assets. It will also make a significant contribution to help absorb transaction costs.Alliance Trust shareholders are not expected to suffer any net asset value dilution from the direct costs of the transactions, the firms noted.The deal is expected to complete by the start of the fourth quarter of 2024, at the latest.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: The investment trust M&A machine has been going into overdrive over the past year or so.Investors who want to beat the market often turn to actively-managed investment funds or trusts in the hope they will outperform. Given that these fund managers are collecting an annual fee, one would hope they can do better than the market, but Witan has found it hard to achieve this on a sustainable basis,Retirement plans for Witan's chief executive Andrew Bell prompted a review of the trust, and it was effectively plonked on the market.Witan announced in March that Bell would be stepping down after 14 years with the business.Apax Global Alpha unveiled a new capital allocation framework and kicked off a share buyback programme and also revealed that its long-serving chair would be stepping down.Market MoversFTSE 250 - RisersFuture (FUTR) 1,074.00p 7.08% Apax Global Alpha Limited (APAX) 160.00p 4.17% Rotork (ROR) 335.40p 3.01% Carnival (CCL) 1,283.50p 2.60% Centamin (DI) (CEY) 120.20p 2.47% Witan Inv Trust (WTAN) 266.50p 2.11% Britvic (BVIC) 1,181.00p 1.81% Indivior (INDV) 1,282.00p 1.67% CMC Markets (CMCX) 319.00p 1.59% Petershill Partners (PHLL) 209.00p 1.46%FTSE 250 - FallersPagegroup (PAGE) 423.60p -6.28% Trustpilot Group (TRST) 220.00p -4.35% Alpha Group International (ALPH) 2,270.00p -4.22% PureTech Health (PRTC) 185.80p -3.43% Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings (AML) 150.10p -3.04% Hays (HAS) 95.90p -2.84% SDCL Energy Efficiency Income Trust (SEIT) 66.00p -2.65% Lancashire Holdings Limited (LRE) 590.00p -2.48% Helios Towers (HTWS) 119.00p -2.46% Jupiter Fund Management (JUP) 76.70p -2.29%"},

The FTSE 100 was up 0.2% at 8,260.82, off earlier highs, having taken its opening cue from a tech rally on Wall Street, which saw the Nasdaq end 1.3% higher.Susannah Streeter head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: An uptick in confidence has sent the FTSE 100 higher, after US tech staged a rebound, particularly the chipmaker Nvidia.Fears of a big imminent market wobble are now receding. However, there are still concerns hanging around about stubborn inflation, with a hotter than expected reading in Australia sending the ASX 200 in Sydney lower. Brent Crude has edged up slightly above $85 a barrel, amid continued geo-political concerns, even though there was an uptick in US crude stockpiles.

In currency markets, sterling was last down 0.48% on the dollar, trading at $1.2625, as it slipped 0.19% against the euro, changing hands at €1.1817. Tech stocks continue to cling on to small gains this afternoon but the broader tone is firmly negative, said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp.Monday's session had shown the signs of rotation that so many investors had been hoping for, transferring leadership from unstoppable tech names to unloved sectors, but this has fizzled out rapidly.Higher inflation in Australia has not helped matters, and raises the uncomfortable prospect that the major bugbear of the past two years is set to make an unwelcome return, leading to rate hikes featuring in central bank policy once again.Beauchamp said all eyes were now firmly on Friday's PCE data in the US, at least until Sunday's French elections.Faced with resurgent inflation in Australia, investors have slammed the 'buy' button on the dollar this afternoon, which in its turn has sent gold down to a two-week low.Like stocks there had been hope of a sustained turn higher, but a test of the recent lows around $2,280 seems likely.Retail sales see notable downturn in JuneIn economic news, retail sales in the UK experienced a notable decline in June, reversing the temporary uplift observed in May, according to the latest CBI distributive trades survey.The survey revealed that retail sales volumes fell sharply, with a weighted net balance of -24, a significant drop from May's balance of 8.It highlighted that sales were well below the average for the time of year, and were expected to continue their decline in July, albeit at a slower rate, with a forecast balance of -9.Despite the current downturn, the CBI pointed out improving consumer fundamentals, citing a decrease in headline consumer price index inflation to 2% - the Bank of England's target - and rising incomes.Additionally, the Bank of England was anticipated to begin reducing interest rates soon, potentially boosting consumer confidence.Last month's nascent recovery in sales proved to be short-lived, with retailers reporting a faster-than-anticipated decline this month, said Alpesh Paleja, interim deputy chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry.Unseasonably cold weather in [early] June may have played a role, but it's notable that internet retail sales fell sharply too.In Germany, consumer sentiment took an unexpected downturn, declining for the first time in five months.GfK's forward-looking consumer confidence survey for July dropped to -21.8 from a revised -21.0 in June, contrary to economists' predictions of an improvement to -18.9.The survey indicated an increase in consumers' willingness to save, which rose by 3.2 points to 8.2, while the willingness to buy fell by 0.7 points to -13, largely due to rising prices.The future outlook also appeared bleak, with the income expectations sub-index decreasing by 4.3 points to 8.2 and economic prospects plunging by 7.3 points to 2.5. Future rockets on price target hike, Phoenix Group in the redOn London's equity markets, AO World saw a modest rise of 1.06% after the online electricals retailer reported a substantial increase in full-year profits, which surged 186% to Â£34.4m despite a 9% decline in revenue to Â£1.04bn.That exceeded the company's own profit guidance range, reflecting successful strategic shifts towards profit and cash generation.Publisher Future surged 8.28% after receiving a double upgrade to 'buy' from Jefferies, which also raised its price target to 1,280p from 635p. Deliveroo increased 1.18%, following a report that US meal delivery company Doordash showed interest in a takeover last month.Talks reportedly ended due to a disagreement on valuation, with no ongoing discussions at present.Anglo American managed a slight gain of 0.3% despite another decline in rough diamond sales from its De Beers unit.De Beers recorded its fifth sales cycle generating $315 million, down from previous cycles and last year's figures.Alliance Trust and Witan Investment Trust rose 0.5% and 2.49%, respectively, after announcing a merger to create a major new Â£5bn investment vehicle, Alliance Witan.The new entity was expected to qualify for FTSE 100 inclusion, offering a more liquid and cost-efficient investment option.On the downside, Phoenix Group Holdings fell 1.52% after the insurance and pensions group announced its intention to sell its SunLife business, deeming it non-core to its operations.Although there had been significant interest, the sale's completion remains uncertain.Liontrust Asset Management slumped 3.78%, revealing a small loss for the year ended 31 March.The company faced net outflows of over Â£6bn due to an adverse trading environment.Legal & General Group was down 0.7% after its investment management division LGIM decided to divest from commodities miner and trader Glencore due to its thermal coal operations.The decision was part of L&G's latest climate impact pledge report, affecting various ESG and pension funds.Glencore, despite the divestment news, saw a slight uptick of 0.11%.Elsewhere, Haleon slipped 0.27% after agreeing to sell its nicotine replacement therapy business outside the US to Dr Reddy's Laboratories for Â£500m.The sale would include well-known brands like Nicotinell, Nicabate, Habitrol, and Thrive, available across over 30 markets.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com.Market MoversFTSE 100 (UKX) 8,225.33 -0.27% FTSE 250 (MCX) 20,298.10 -0.32% techMARK (TASX) 4,754.74 -0.53%FTSE 100 - RisersCentrica (CNA) 137.90p 1.43% Marks & Spencer Group (MKS) 291.70p 1.39% Convatec Group (CTEC) 234.60p 1.38% Fresnillo (FRES) 566.50p 1.25% Scottish Mortgage Inv Trust (SMT) 888.40p 1.21% Kingfisher (KGF) 247.00p 1.15% Associated British Foods (ABF) 2,524.00p 1.04% Diploma (DPLM) 4,140.00p 1.02% Sage Group (SGE) 1,091.50p 1.02% Croda International (CRDA) 4,061.00p 0.84%FTSE 100 - FallersInternational Consolidated Airlines Group SA (CDI) (IAG) 163.85p -2.59% Flutter Entertainment (DI) (FLTR) 14,440.00p -2.43% Smurfit Kappa Group (CDI) (SKG) 3,538.00p -2.16% easyJet (EZJ) 454.60p -1.94% Land Securities Group (LAND) 613.50p -1.92% Entain (ENT) 648.40p -1.82% Phoenix Group Holdings (PHNX) 517.50p -1.71% Frasers Group (FRAS) 885.00p -1.39% Imperial Brands (IMB) 2,029.00p -1.27% Taylor Wimpey (TW.) 142.00p -1.18%FTSE 250 - RisersFuture (FUTR) 1,086.00p 8.28% Carnival (CCL) 1,312.50p 4.92% Indivior (INDV) 1,312.00p 4.04% Apax Global Alpha Limited (APAX) 158.60p 3.26% Rotork (ROR) 334.80p 2.83% Britvic (BVIC) 1,192.00p 2.76% Witan Inv Trust (WTAN) 267.50p 2.49% Centamin (DI) (CEY) 120.20p 2.47% Bakkavor Group (BAKK) 146.00p 2.46% CMC Markets (CMCX) 321.50p 2.39%FTSE 250 - FallersPagegroup (PAGE) 429.00p -5.09% Trustpilot Group (TRST) 219.00p -4.78% Alpha Group International (ALPH) 2,280.00p -3.80% Hays (HAS) 95.10p -3.65% Helios Towers (HTWS) 117.80p -3.44% Kier Group (KIE) 133.20p -2.77% Ocado Group (OCDO) 282.40p -2.75% SSP Group (SSPG) 150.80p -2.65% Just Group (JUST) 103.60p -2.63% Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings (AML) 150.80p -2.58%"},

The latest snapshot of business activity in the US has caused fresh uncertainty, with the PMI numbers showing robust growth. There are worries it could lead to the Fed holding off from cutting interest rates for longer. The official US GDP data out on Thursday will be closely watched to establish just how stubborn inflation could be in the last yards down to target.The UK's growth snapshot is out on Friday, and although the expectations are that it might show a shift out of stagnation mode, it's unlikely to be so significant that it'll help propel the Conservatives' election prospects forward in any meaningful way.In equity markets, Prudential was the standout gainer on the FTSE 100 after saying it would return $2bn to investors via a share buyback to be completed by mid-2026.Britvic fizzed higher again as Carlsberg confirmed that PepsiCo has agreed to waive the change of control clause in the bottling arrangements it has with Britvic, removing a potential hurdle in the Danish brewer's pursuit of the UK drinks company.Britvic shares surged on Friday after it confirmed it had rejected a £3.1bn takeover proposal from Carlsberg.Ecommerce services and fulfilment group THG advanced as it announced a new multi-year partnership with retail conglomerate Frasers Group that includes the sale of its portfolio of luxury goods websites.

Results on 6 June revealed that record revenues of £4.51bn for the year ended 31 March, up 11% year-on-year, while adjusted operating profit surged 30% to £210m.EBITDA came in at £268m, up from £214.5m the year before, ahead of the group's own £200m target and 5% above Deutsche Bank's forecast, while free cash flow beat analysts' estimates by 3%, surging to £158m from £66m.With the business having made a positive start to FY25E we upgrade FY25-27E EPS by 2-5%, said analyst James Beard.We expect the UK General Election to have a relatively minor impact on growth in the near-term, and we do not expect a possible Labour administration to meaningfully change the public sector contracting environment.Deutsche Bank kept a 'buy' rating on the stock, which was up 2.1% at 119.6p by 1222 BST, putting its year-to-date gains at more than 22%. Analysts at Jefferies hiked their target price on shares of Rolls-Royce, pointing to its most recent trading update, which they said implied the potential for positive surprises as regarded the engineer's free cash flow guidance.So much so that they expected the engineer would be able to hit its 2027 FCF guidance one year ahead of plan thanks to improved civil After Market margins.They also noted the upcoming key catalysts for the share price in the form of the Farnborough airshow between 22-28 July and the company's first half results on 1 August.All told, they raised their target price for the shares from 530.0p to 580.0p, on the back of 4-9% upgrades to their estimates for Rolls's earnings per share.Their recommendation was kept at 'buy'.They also said that cash returns were nearing. Hence,, they also raised their valuation multiples closer to their 'bull' case.Those multiple were 19 times for Civil, a 5% free cash flow yield, against 17 times and 5.5% previously."},

London stocks closed on a positive note on Monday, driven by robust performances from Prudential and Frasers Group.The FTSE 100 rose 0.53%, ending the day at 8,281.55 points, while the FTSE 250 gained 0.59%, reaching 20,562.57 by the close.In currency markets, sterling was last up 0.31% on the dollar, trading at $1.2684, while it experienced a slight decline of 0.03% against the euro to change hands at €1.1821.Just as worries about poor market breadth hit the mainstream, breadth begins to recover, said IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp.Last week saw Nvidia soar and the Nasdaq 100 hit 20,000, but the new week has continued where Friday left off, with old economy stocks rallying and tech continuing to drop back.Beauchamp said that kind of rotation was very healthy for a continuation of the rally into July.Fresh inflows are driving the FTSE 100 higher too, and the gains are not confined to the UK.Political risk is off the agenda today it seems, as the CAC 40 shrugs off impending French elections and the DAX makes gains too.Despite a lack of news today it seems that investors remain content to buy the dip.UK manufacturing output stable, first-time mortgage payments riseIn economic news, UK manufacturers reported stable output volumes in the three months leading to June, according to a fresh survey from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).The stability followed a rise in output in the previous quarter, marking the first increase in 18 months.Looking ahead, manufacturers were expecting a modest output increase in the next quarter.Despite improvements in total order books in May, export orders saw a significant decline, remaining below normal levels.Manufacturers reported sufficient stocks of finished goods to meet demand, while expectations for selling price inflation rose, with prices projected to increase at an above-average rate in the coming months.We've seen a stop-start recovery in manufacturing output in recent months, with higher activity over the last quarter concentrated in a relatively small number of manufacturing sub-sectors, said the CBI's lead economist, Ben Jones.But it's encouraging to see that manufacturers remain confident the economy is heading in the right direction and our June survey suggests that the recovery should broaden out over the summer.One note of caution is that order books remain soft - the sharp deterioration in export order books is particularly striking and is something to keep an eye on in the coming months.The survey, which included responses from 248 manufacturers, indicated that only four out of 17 sub-sectors experienced output growth in the three months to June.Notable growth was observed in the food, drink, and tobacco, motor vehicle and transport, and plastics and furniture sub-sectors.Total order books, although improved from May, remained below long-run averages, while export orders fell to their lowest since February 2021.The expectation for average selling price inflation increased significantly in June, suggesting higher prices in the near future.In the housing market, first-time buyers faced significantly higher mortgage payments, with monthly payments rising by nearly two-thirds since the last general election, according to data from lender Rightmove.The typical monthly payment for a first-time buyer was now Â£1,075, up from Â£667 in 2019, which was attributed to the rise in the average five-year fixed 80% loan-to-value mortgage rate from 2.24% to 5.09%.In contrast, average wages had risen by only 27% over the same period.The average price of a typical first home has also increased by 19% to Â£227,757, with regional variations showing the north west experiencing a 33% rise, while London saw a 6% increase.In Germany, business sentiment declined in June, as reported by the Ifo Institute.The business climate index dropped to 88.6 from 89.3 in May, while the current situation index remained steady at 88.3, while the expectations index fell to 89.0 from 90.3.Prudential and Frasers in the green, SIG falls backOn London's equity markets, Prudential surged 7.41% following the company's announcement of a $2bn share buyback programme, set to be completed by mid-2026.Frasers Group rose 3.35% after announcing a multi-year partnership with e-commerce group THG, which itself saw a 1.55% increase.The collaboration would include integrating Frasers Plus, a customer credit and loyalty proposition, into THG's Ingenuity platform, alongside Frasers acquiring THG's luxury brand portfolio.Britvic jumped 7.13%, continuing its upward momentum.The rise came after Carlsberg confirmed that PepsiCo would waive the change of control clause in its bottling arrangements with Britvic.That removed a potential obstacle for Carlsberg's pursuit of Britvic, following Britvic's rejection of a Â£3.1bn takeover proposal from Carlsberg last Friday.On the downside, SIG dropped 5.3% after the insulation and building products group issued a profit warning due to a challenging first half, with ongoing softness in the building and construction sector across Europe leading to subdued demand in most of its markets.Smurfit Kappa Group fell 2% after a rise last week, when it was confirmed that Smurfit WestRock would be included in the S&P Dow Jones Indices starting 9 July.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com.Market MoversFTSE 100 (UKX) 8,281.55 0.53% FTSE 250 (MCX) 20,562.57 0.59% techMARK (TASX) 4,819.15 -0.05%FTSE 100 -

In the UK, meanwhile, first-quarter GDP figures will be published.In equity markets, Rolls-Royce, Melrose Industries and Bodycote all fell after Airbus cut earnings guidance and delivery targets late on Monday.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said: Airbus cut its 2024 delivery target from 800 to 770, and delayed increasing output of the A320 to 2027, citing 'persistent' supply chain challenges. It also took a €900m charge at its Space Systems. It might not have much impact on airlines, who have already indicated that Airbus has reduced scheduled deliveries. But aircraft manufacturing is proving tricky - just ask Boeing. Demand is not the problem; quite the reverse. But if supply can't keep pace and competition so constrained, it ought to mean airline capacity doesn't increase too much, which could keep fares higher for longer.Ocado was also under the cosh after Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the shares to 215p from 345p.On the upside, Admiral was the standout gainer on the FTSE 100 after an upgrade to 'buy' from 'hold' at Berenberg.

Big falls from biopharma group Merck and aerospace giant Airbus were weighing heavily on sentiment, while growing uncertainty ahead of this week's elections in France were keeping a lid on risk appetite.Coming off the back of a US session that had seen weakness across both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, that same downbeat tone appears to be evident in Europe despite a lack of any particularly notable economic releases this morning, said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at IG.The pan-European Stoxx 600 benchmark index was 0.3% lower by lunchtime. Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 were the worst performers of the session, down 1% and 0.6% respectively; while markets in the UK, Spain and Italy fell by a lesser amount.Merck plummeted after the biopharma group called time on a cancer drug trial of lack of efficacy. The company stopped its trial of head and neck cancer treatment xevinapant, marking another surprising setback for the healthcare pipeline, according to analysts at Barclays.Airbus was out of favour after cutting its full-year earnings targets as a result of a degraded operating environment, meaning it would only deliver around 700 aircraft this year, compared with previous guidance of 800. Annual EBITDA is now expected to be €5.5bn, down from earlier guidance of €7bn.Sentiment in the travel and aerospace sector was also dented by news overnight that a Boeing plane operating a Korean Air flight heading for Taiwan dropped 25,000 feet in five minutes after a fault with its pressurisation system, adding to more woes for the American aircraft manufacturer.Meanwhile, US prosecutors recommended overnight that the Department of Justice bring criminal charges against Boeing for violating a settlement related to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.Aerospace and engineering firms were all in the red in Europe, with MTU Aero Engines, Melrose, Rolls-Royce, SAFRAN, Trelleborg and Dassault Aviation all falling sharply.London's FTSE 100 was outperforming wider European markets, falling by just 0.1% as downside was limited by gains from heavyweights Shell and BP.Economic data was thin on the ground on Tuesday, with revisions to first-quarter GDP in Spain the only notable release. The economy expanded by 0.8% in the first three months of 2024, up from the initial estimate of 0.7% and the 0.7% growth seen in the fourth quarter - marking the strongest quarterly growth in nearly two years. The annual growth rate was also revised 10 basis points higher to 2.5%."},

We reiterate our 'buy' rating on Segro as real estate markets navigate the remainder of the cyclical trough and look forward to next-cycle upside, that for Segro we expect has begun, the US bank said in a research note.Segro's investment case is one of structural rental growth from the gradual march of online retail, increasing supply chain robustness, urban demand growth, and a demand inflection for data centres.Citi reckons that Segro's portfolio will generate like-for-like rental growth per annum of 7% over the long term, if not more, and that the portfolio value has 35% upside. Completions in developments and future acquisitions could also significantly upgrade earnings over the next few years.The stock could return to historic bull market multiples as cyclical confidence builds that could create further upside, Citi said.Berenberg upgraded Admiral on Tuesday to 'buy' from 'hold' and lifted the price target to 3,127p from 2,973p, citing an attractive valuation.Investor Warren Buffett once said: 'It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.' Fortunately, today investors can buy Admiral, a wonderful company, also at a wonderful price.It noted that since it downgraded the shares in December, they have gone sideways. The stock has de-rated and underperformed the sector by around 10%. However, Berenberg reckons they now look cheap again.The bank also pointed out that Admiral is trading towards the bottom end of its price-to-earnings range and said it thinks there is scope for further earnings per share upgrades, in particular because it feels the price increases are still not appropriately reflected in consensus estimates for 2024. Berenberg is now 20% ahead of consensus EPS for FY24E. Deutsche Bank hiked its price target on Rolls-Royce to 555p from 465p on Tuesday as it revisited the valuation ahead of first-half results.The bank said the first-quarter update provided evidence that execution at Rolls-Royce is improving.While our 2024-2027 estimates are broadly unchanged, our degree of confidence in the company's ability to deliver on its transformation programme has increased, it said.Ahead of the H1 release on 1 August, we adopt a scenario described in a previous note: we move our valuation to 2027e, based on increased confidence in 2027 target attainment.DB rates the shares at 'buy'.At 1215 BST, the shares were down 3.8% at 453.40p, taking a hit from the profit warning from Airbus late on Thursday."},

Demand is not the problem; quite the reverse.But if supply can't keep pace and competition is so constrained, it ought to mean airline capacity doesn't increase too much, which could keep fares higher for longer.Elsewhere, Ocado Group saw a substantial drop of 6.49% after Morgan Stanley reduced its price target on the shares from 345p to 215p, impacting investor sentiment negatively.Saga experienced a reversal of earlier gains, closing 1.95% lower despite the over-50s holidays and financial products firm affirming that it remained on track to meet its financial year targets, even amidst ongoing challenges in the insurance market.On the upside, Admiral Group rose 2.16% after an upgrade to 'buy' from 'hold' by Berenberg, which highlighted the stock's attractive valuation and potential for further earnings per share (EPS) upgrades.Investor Warren Buffett once said: 'It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price', Berenberg said in a research note.Fortunately, today investors can buy Admiral, a wonderful company, also at a wonderful price.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com.Market MoversFTSE 100 (UKX) 8,247.79 -0.41% FTSE 250 (MCX) 20,363.43 -0.97% techMARK (TASX) 4,780.09 -0.81%FTSE 100 - RisersAdmiral Group (ADM) 2,627.00p 2.26% easyJet (EZJ) 463.60p 1.85% Smith (DS) (SMDS) 370.80p 1.42% Flutter Entertainment (DI) (FLTR) 14,800.00p 1.37% Sage Group (SGE) 1,080.50p 1.31% Anglo American (AAL) 2,520.00p 0.80% National Grid (NG.) 895.00p 0.70% AstraZeneca (AZN) 12,550.00p 0.58% Whitbread (WTB) 2,977.00p 0.54% Berkeley Group Holdings (The) (BKG) 4,654.00p 0.47%FTSE 100 - FallersBurberry Group (BRBY) 972.60p -4.46% Convatec Group (CTEC) 231.40p -4.14% BT Group (BT.A) 139.95p -3.52% Rightmove (RMV) 549.60p -3.10% Marks & Spencer Group (MKS) 287.70p -2.80% WPP (WPP) 743.80p -2.80% Weir Group (WEIR) 1,991.00p -2.78% Ashtead Group (AHT) 5,354.00p -2.55% Melrose Industries (MRO) 567.80p -2.37% Vodafone Group (VOD) 70.66p -2.27%FTSE 250 - RisersCarnival (CCL) 1,251.00p 9.35% SDCL Energy Efficiency Income Trust (SEIT) 67.80p 5.94% XPS Pensions Group (XPS) 300.00p 3.09% Helios Towers (HTWS) 122.00p 2.69% Tritax Eurobox (GBP) (EBOX) 60.60p 2.37% Moonpig Group (MOON) 158.00p 1.67% JPMorgan Japanese Inv Trust (JFJ) 529.00p 1.54% SSP Group (SSPG) 154.90p 1.24% FirstGroup (FGP) 158.30p 1.21% Balanced Commercial Property Trust Limited (BCPT) 78.00p 1.04%FTSE 250 - FallersOcado Group (OCDO) 290.40p -7.07% Bodycote (BOY) 690.00p -5.61% PZ Cussons (PZC) 100.60p -3.82% Abrdn (ABDN) 147.30p -3.76% IP Group (IPO) 43.20p -3.46% WH Smith (SMWH) 1,156.00p -3.44% Oxford Instruments (OXIG) 2,545.00p -3.42% 4Imprint Group (FOUR) 5,950.00p -3.41% Jupiter Fund Management (JUP) 78.50p -3.33% Genus (GNS) 1,672.00p -3.24%"},

Airbus finished the day down nearly 10% in Paris, dropping to its lowest levels of the year, after cutting its full-year earnings targets as a result of a degraded operating environment. 'Bad news from aerospace firm Airbus hit European markets, knocking these back after a solid start to the week yesterday, said Axel Rudolph, senior market analyst at IG.The Dax dropped 0.8% - with Frankfurt-listed shares of biopharma group Merck weighing heavily - while the Cac 40, Ibex 35, FTSE 100 and FTSE MIB all fell around 0.4-0.6%.Nevertheless, the Stoxx 600 index finished the day down a lesser 0.2% with decent gains in the wider pharma and biotech sectors limiting falls.In France, the final week of campaigning began before the first round of voting in snap elections, as president Emmanuel Macro promised profound change if he is re-elected leader.Even the head of Euronext said in an interview that the French elections were causing investors concerns. If a team that has never governed comes to power, there is total uncertainty, a complete unknown, said chief executive Stephane Boujnah in a radio interview.Economic data was thin on the ground on Tuesday, with revisions to first-quarter GDP in Spain the only notable release.

However, the European firm is encountering some turbulence of its own and that is having a knock-on effect upon the companies that form part of its supply chain, said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.Merck plummeted 6% after the biopharma group called time on a cancer drug trial of lack of efficacy. The company stopped its trial of head and neck cancer treatment xevinapant, marking another surprising setback for the healthcare pipeline, according to analysts at Barclays. Despite Merck's fall, pharma and biotech companies fared well on Tuesday, dominating the risers list on the Stoxx 600. Zealand Pharma, Argenx, Eurofins Scientific, Novo Nordisk and Evotec were all rising strongly.Admiral was a standout performer in London after Berenberg upgraded the insurer to 'buy' from 'hold' and lifted the price target to 3,127p from 2,973p, citing an attractive valuation."},

Admiral rallied to the top of the index after Berenberg upgraded shares of the insurer to 'buy' from 'hold' and lifted the price target to 3,127p from 2,973p, citing an attractive valuation.Investor Warren Buffett once said: 'It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.' Fortunately, today investors can buy Admiral, a wonderful company, also at a wonderful price, it said.It noted that since it downgraded the shares in December, they have gone sideways. The stock has de-rated and underperformed the sector by around 10%. However, in Berenberg's view, the shares now look cheap again.The bank pointed out that Admiral is trading towards the bottom end of its price-to-earnings range and said it thinks there is scope for further earnings per share upgrades, in particular because it feels the price increases are still not appropriately reflected in consensus estimates for 2024. Berenberg is now 20% ahead of consensus EPS for FY24E.Rolls-Royce and Melrose Industries were both weaker after Airbus cut earnings guidance and delivery targets late on Monday.

Both indices have been on the retreat since hitting fresh record highs on 18 June as investors took profits in Nvidia following the stock's eye-watering rise so far this year. Nvidia was up 3.2% in early deals after a 13% drop over the past three sessions.There are a few FOMC members speaking this afternoon, but otherwise the calendar is light. That suggests that NVIDIA will continue to pull the focus as analysts debate just how valuable the company could become, given its pole position in the future development of generative AI, said David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.2% lower on the back of a drop in the price of heavyweight Boeing, after a Korean Air Boeing aircraft heading for Taiwan dropped 25,000 feet in five minutes following a fault with its pressurisation system. Separately, US prosecutors recommended overnight that the Department of Justice bring criminal charges against Boeing for violating a settlement related to two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.Also weighing on sentiment in the aerospace sector was an update from French giant Airbus which slashed its full-year earnings and delivery targets for the year as a result of a degraded operating environment.Microsoft was trading lower after the European Union accused the company of violating competition regulations, through the abusive bundling of its Teams and Office products. The accusation stemmed from Microsoft's practice of tying its Teams communication tool to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites, which the EU claims restricts competition.Tesla rose despite the news it is to recall 11,000 Cybertrucks after issues were found with its wipers and trunk-bed trims.In economic news, the S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index showed annual growth slowing to 7.2% in April from 7.5% in March, though still well above the 6.9% consensus forecast.Meanwhile, the national consumer confidence index by the Conference Board fell to 100.4 from 101.3, coming in marginally ahead of the 100 reading expected."}
